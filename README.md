# CSC207: Week3 Project Assignment
1) Our problem domain:

  We are planning on making an interactive trivia game that tests users on their knowledge across different categories like Geography, Sports, Science, Entertainment and
  History, among others. 
  
2) The kind of application our team is thinking of developing:

  We are planning to develop an app that contains both single-player and multiplayer game modes. If the user selects the single-player mode, they will be put up against a
  series of questions from a range of different categories. These questions will be generated using the Trivia API. In this game mode, each right answer will win the player
  in-game cash, with extra ‘bonus’ cash attributed for long streaks of correct answers. This in-game cash can then be used to unlock certain perks in the game, perhaps a new
  skin or profile badge. Meanwhile, in the multiplayer game mode, the player will be able to go up against different players in a live trivia contest. Additionally, we are
  looking to implement a leaderboard system which ranks different players based on their performance in the game.
  
3) A link to the documentation for an API that our team uses related to the domain:
   
  https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
  
4) A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like https://www.postman.com/, or https://hoppscotch.io/)
